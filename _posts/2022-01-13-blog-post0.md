Hi everyone! Let me introduce a simple method to draw a visualization of the palmers penguins.

## Read in the data

- Today we are using the palmers penguin dataset to generate an interesting image. First we want to read in the data using the read_csv command.

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Clean the data

- From the chart we have just created we can clearly see that there are some NA in "body mass" and "sex".
- Since these NA will mess up our plot, we choose to remove the rows and columns with NA.
```python
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])
```
- We notice that the names of the penguins are too long, so we split the words up
- and only take the first word to be their name.
```python
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```
- There is a suspecious dot in "Sex"! We remove the dot from the dataset.
```python
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."]
```
- We only keep the above columns for our analysis 

```python
cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]
penguins = penguins[cols]

```

## Plot the data

```python
#We import the following packages to better illustrate the plot
from plotly import express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.io import write_html
#plotting the plot
fig = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins, 
                 x = "Culmen Length (mm)", 
                 y = "Culmen Depth (mm)",
                 color = "Species",
                 hover_name = "Species",
                 hover_data = ["Island", "Sex"],
                 size = "Body Mass (g)",
                 width = 500,
                 height = 300,
                 opacity = 0.5)

# reduce whitespace
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
write_html(fig, "example_fig.html")
```

From the picture we can see the data of each penguin labeled in different colors in accordance to their species. The size="Body Mass (g)" command in the above code block allows us to make the points' size in accordance to the penguins' masses.
